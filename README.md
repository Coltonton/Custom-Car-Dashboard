# Custom-Car-Dashboard
 A project of mine I have been working on for a long time to replace the center screen in my Subaru Legacy. Fully working for my build, Need to implement CAN, and finish some things up id say 80% done now??
 I have included the old CPP code for archival reasons; Its been so long I dont have the slightest clue how functional it is...

 Far from finished, thought I'd upload to git to have a "cloud" backup of over a thousnd? *thinking emoji* of hours of work into this project... including previous attempts and versions **thonk** 

 Current version intended to be ran on a linux machine, I had played with (and 75% wrote) the code for it to work on an ESP32 but decided to run it off the AtomicPi QuadCore SBC runining ubuntu 20 that I'll be installing in my car anyway...
